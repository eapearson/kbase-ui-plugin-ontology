# KBase UI Plugin: Ontology

> View ontology terms, and navigate within an ontology.

This is a plugin for [kbase-ui](https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui), which allows a KBase user to view individual ontological terms, and navigate within the ontology to which that term belongs.

The canonical home for it is https://narrative.kbase.us#ontology.

Currently the Ontology plugin supports [Gene Ontology (GO)](http://geneontology.org) and [Environment Ontology (ENVO)](http://www.environmentontology.org) ontologies.

## Usage

Ontology terms are typically linked from other parts of KBase, although you can simply invoke the appropriate url to view them, if you know the url format and the terms involved.

While viewing a term, other terms are exposed as links. For example, since ontologies are trees, you can view parents and children of a term and click on them to view them. Therefore, this tool enables hou to navigate the entire ontology.

### Viewing a Term

[https://ci.kbase.us#ontology/term/go_ontology/GO:0008152](https://narrative.kbase.us#ontology/go_ontology/GO:0008152) will show the term for "metabolic process" in the Gene Ontology.
