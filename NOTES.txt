Ontology Plugin Notes

6/30/20 - 

separated out from re-landing pages

the design has shifted from re-centric to ontology-centric

this greatly simplifies the design

originally the request was for a "landing page" for any relation engine entity.

but the concept of a relation engine entity has not really materialized as an architecturally recognized thing.

lots of things are stuffed into the re db.

so, rather, this repo is dedicated to ontology as a service, or area of knowledge and relationships.

so, we start with the landing page at #ontology/term

this gives us room for #ontology/search, etc. (if there are any ceteras!)

Workwise, the steps look like:

- create new repo
- copy over the re landing pages code
- remove the taxonomy bits
- add new routing definitions
- add the plugin to kbase-ui
- refactor the routing to remove the "generic" re stuff, with knowledge that the only things we'll see (in #ontology/term) are ontology terms,.


Navigation -- work with what is here now.

need to finalize the navigation design for plugins, though ... 
see sampleview for another approach.


the typing needs a lot of cleanup to remove all the generic part of re identity...

ontology boils down to:

NAMESPACE/term

go_ontology/GO:1234

we call this the ontology reference, OntologyReference.

this is different than the term as delivered from the service,
which will have more info... we'll work on that later.
